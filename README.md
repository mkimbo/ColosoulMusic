  Colosoul Music Web app
</h1>

<h4>
  A responsive and easily configurable <a href="https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby" target="_blank">Gatsby</a> website that brings audio to life on the web. It is based on the **Level 2** or short **LvL2** starter that I modified to come up with this minimalistic application. It uses Graphql and markdown for the programmatically generated pages and their data.

# Quick start

1.  **Create a Gatsby site from the original starter.**

    Use the Gatsby CLI to create a new site, specifying the _level-2_ starter.

    ```shell
    # create a new Gatsby site using the level-2 starter
    gatsby new my-portfolio https://github.com/Knochenmark/gatsby-starter-level-2
    ```

1.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into your new siteâ€™s directory and start it up.

    ```shell
    cd my-portfolio/
    gatsby develop
    ```

1.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._
